One of the best DC movies after a while. Dwayne at his best caliber carried the entire movie on his shoulders. 
The BGM is awesome and it gives slight resemblance of Moon knight theme. Worth watching in theater and trust me you won’t check your watch or mobile in between. 
It’s intense from beginning to end with some fun loving conversations between JSA and Dwayne.

This movie does not suck! Probably one of the best fan fun movies I watched in a while. I give it an atom smashing 10/10.

Worst jumpscares and worst ending. The only jumpscares in this movie is a random person smiling with a loud sound effect. 
The house burning scene could have been a fine ending to this movie since it gives the message of "Face your fears". 
But no, the movie had to continue to have a bad ending. I feel like they only continued the movie for the trash plot twist and to show the audience how it enters people
(wich I don't even care). She had so many opportunities to kill someone or herself, but she had to procrastinate it.

This was mediocre. Had a few good jump scares, but I wouldn't say it was that scary. Also this the 'gore' at the end was unnecessary and didn't add anything to the movie. 
Could have been way better.

As a tremendous Uncharted game series fan, I was super excited for this movie but I was left feeling less than overwhelmed with joy.
