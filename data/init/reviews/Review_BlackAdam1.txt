One of the best DC movies after a while. Dwayne at his best caliber carried the entire movie on his shoulders. |The BGM is awesome and it gives slight resemblance of Moon knight theme. Worth watching in theater and trust me you won’t check your watch or mobile in between. |It’s intense from beginning to end with some fun loving conversations between JSA and Dwayne.
