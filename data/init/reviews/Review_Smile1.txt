Worst jumpscares and worst ending. The only jumpscares in this movie is a random person smiling with a loud sound effect. |The house burning scene could have been a fine ending to this movie since it gives the message of "Face your fears". |But no, the movie had to continue to have a bad ending. I feel like they only continued the movie for the trash plot twist and to show the audience how it enters people|(wich I don't even care). She had so many opportunities to kill someone or herself, but she had to procrastinate it.
